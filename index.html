      <p>
        In this project, I successfully completed a series of tasks. Using C++
        and SDL3, I implemented an engine responsible for managing game objects
        and resources. This engine played a crucial role in game development,
        handling tasks such as graphics rendering, resource loading, and
        management. I also made the engine data-driven through pybind11,
        allowing scripts for game objects creating and scene data to be loaded
        at runtime. To enhance the game's appeal and challenge, I introduced
        hidden wall elements in the game design, offering players a fresh,
        strategic gaming experience (which can be my 'wow' factor).
        Additionally, I utilized SDL3 Mixer in C++ to implement an audio
        component, enriching the game with background music and various sound
        effects, making it more vibrant and immersive.
      </p>

        Despite achieving some success, I acknowledge certain shortcomings in
        the project. Due to time and technical constraints, I couldn't realize
        all ideas and functionalities. For instance, I could enhance user
        engagement by allowing them to adjust the map size for increased editing
        freedom, add enemy movement patterns to chase the player for heightened
        difficulty, display scores on-screen for improved user feedback, and
        incorporate animated effects like breaking walls or collecting jewels to
        enhance visual appeal and enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I've learned a great deal from this project. After dedicating
        over 6 hours daily and undergoing significant code revisions, I'm
        satisfied with my current progress. Reflecting on the project's
        experiences and shortcomings will better prepare me for future
        endeavors, enabling me to continually elevate my technical skills and
        game development capabilities.
